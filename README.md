Hybrid Horror Platformer
------------------------
This game is made for Github Game Off 2018.
As the theme of the Game Off is hybrid. I decided to make a Horror Platformer game.

Setup
-----
You, an investigator, have accidentally released some eldritch abominations you silly bugger.
Now he has to find a way to seal them back to wherever they came from, but his  nerves aren’t what they used to be and those things are really scary.
And worst of all some insane cultists seem really pleased with your work or releasing them. Those beings don’t seem to care about them though.
When close to monsters he loses sanity and when his sanity is depleted game over (?)
Puzzle element(?) classic collecting keys.

Gameplay
--------
Investigator moves through level avoiding monsters and cultist.
The monsters are near impossible to kill but the cultists go down faster.
The cultist are scary but the monsters are scarier. Both cause decrease in sanity when close.
Defeating an enemy will cause you to regain sanity. And whenever your not near an enemy you will regain sanity.
